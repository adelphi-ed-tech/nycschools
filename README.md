Notebook files
--------------
These Jupyter Notebooks demonstrate core `pandas` and data analaysis
approaches, and model some possible uses for the key school data
that's released as part of the New York City Open Data Portal.

Here's a brief list of the notebooks and main ideas in each:

1. [pandas-basics](https://github.com/adelphi-ed-tech/school-data-portal/blob/main/nb/panda-basics.ipynb):
   - creating `DataFrames` from an API
   - working with `Series` (columns)
   - running aggregate functions
   - data dictionary of the school demographics data set
2. [clean-query](https://github.com/adelphi-ed-tech/school-data-portal/blob/main/nb/clean-query.ipynb)
   - selecting rows from a `DataFrame`
   - creating new `Series` based on calculations
   - pandas `apply()` function
   - python `lambda` functions
   - sorting data
3. [math-ela-merge](https://github.com/adelphi-ed-tech/school-data-portal/blob/main/nb/math-ela-merge.ipynb)
   - (more) cleaning data
   - renaming columns
   - combinging `DataFrames` by joining them with `merge()`
   - dropping columns with `del`
4. [correlations](https://github.com/adelphi-ed-tech/school-data-portal/blob/main/nb/correlations.ipynb)
   - Pearson correlation with `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pingouin`
   - **concatenating** multiple `DataFrames` into a single data set for
     reporting and analysis
   - calculating p-values, power, and confidence intervals
   - running analysis of covariance (ancova)
5. [load-excel-test-data](https://github.com/adelphi-ed-tech/school-data-portal/blob/main/nb/load-excel-test-data.ipynb)
   - reading Excel workbooks with `pandas`
   - reading sheets from Excel into `DataFrames`
   - concatenating `DataFrames`
   - importing custom Python modules that we write into Jupyter
   - using the custom `schools.py` module
6. [ela-pivot](https://github.com/adelphi-ed-tech/school-data-portal/blob/main/nb/ela-pivot.ipynb)
   - convert "long" data to "wide" data
   - use `pandas` `pivot()` function
   - load our custom data saved as .csv from the file system (to avoid long-running code)
