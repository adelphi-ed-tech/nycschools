The **mission** of the NYC Schools Open Data Portal is to make open data
regarding public schools in New York available to everyone interested in
improving our schools, regardless of their technical background or
familiarity with data analysis. We believe that fighting for educational
equity requires us to broaden the audience of who can use and analyze
data. Accordingly, we want to make educational data more accessible,
train people to use it, and demystify and remove the barriers to access.

This portal is meant to:

- make it easier to access the data needed for analysis
- help people learn more about computer programming and data science through studying NYC school data
- encourage people to collaborate in examining data and publishing their findings
