New York Schools Open Data Project
==================================

The mission of the NYC Schools Open Data Project is to make open data
regarding public schools in New York available to everyone interested in
improving our schools, regardless of their technical background or
familiarity with data analysis. We believe that fighting for educational
equity requires us to broaden the audience of who can use and analyze
data. Accordingly, we want to make educational data more accessible,
train people to use it, and demystify and remove the barriers to access.

Our goal is to build platform where any motivated individual or groups
can evaluate available school data, interpret it to help understand
issues they care about, and employ data as part of larger arguments in
our conversations about schools in New York.
