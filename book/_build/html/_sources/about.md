About NYC Schools
=================

The New York City Schools Open Data Project is an Adelphi University research and practice project operated out of the Adelphi Manhattan Institute for STEM and the Imagination (MIXI). Our team consists of motivated graduate students, data scientists, researchers, faculty, and education professionals who are dedicated to gaining better insight into data and education. We welcome help in creating documentation, writing code (help us add more data sets!), and creating in depth case studies and research using this data.
