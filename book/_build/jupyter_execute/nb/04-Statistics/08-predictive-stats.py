# Predictive Statistics
# =====================
# This notebook uses the `sklearn` library to run some machine learning
# predictions using regression analysis. It has examples of both
# Ordinary Least Square and Partial Least Square Regression.
# 
# We look at school demographics to see how well we can use those factors
# to predict mean_scale_score. We look at the grades 3-8 NYS math exams
# for the most recent academic year in our data set.

# Predicting test scores
# -------------------------------
# Using OLS regression we will see how well we can predict mean_scale_score for the
# "All Students" category. We will run this with several variations of factors
# to see which factors have the strongest prediction.
# 
# The basic ideas of a predictive model is that we will use some of our data to
# "train" the model and use the other portion to "test" the model. Once we
# calculate a coeefficient for each factor, we can use those values to
# adjust the data sets mean score for a particular case.
# 
# These examples will use two statistical measures to compare our models:
# 
# - r-squared is a number between 0 and 1 that will tell us how closely our predictions
#   match the actual recorded score (1 is perfect, 0 is no matches)
# - mean squared error (`rmse`) tells us the mean distance between predictions and recorded scores
#   in the same scale as our exam; so an rmse of 10 means that, on average, our predictions were
#   10 points away from the actual score
# 
# 
# ### Correlation table
# First, let's see how the factors correlate with each other, and with our
# dependent variable. This table uses a "coolwarm" color map. Darker red
# indicates a strong positive correlation and darker blue a strong negative correlation.
# 

# In[4]:


# get just the 2019 test results for All Students
# this will be the dependent variable in our regression
data = math_df.query(f"ay == {math_df.ay.max()} and category == 'All Students'")
# calculate coefficients for these factors

# OLS Linear Regression with different factors
# ---------------------------------------------
# 
# We're going to run a linear regression prediction with several different sets of factors to
# see which combination creates the strongest predictive model.
# 
# Because the training and testing sets are randomized we will get slightly different results
# each time we run the code in this cell. It appears that the factors that total enrollment has
# no predictive power and that including poverty_pct without eni_pct produces slightly
# better predictions.
