# `pingouin` stats wrapper
# ------------------------
# The [`pingouin` library](https://pingouin-stats.org/index.html) has a number of functions that "wrap" standard python stats functions to include additional information and nicer formatting out of the box. `ttest` is one of these functions. We can see in the output below that we get the t value, p value (like `scipy.stats`), but we also get degrees of freedom, confidence intervals, and more, without having to calculate these independently for each test.

import pingouin as pg
pg.ttest(charter.mean_scale_score, community.mean_scale_score, correction=False)
