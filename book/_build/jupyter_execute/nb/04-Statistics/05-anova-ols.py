# ANOVA and OLS Regression
# ========================
# This notebook combines school demographic data
# and New York State ELA test scores to examine
# the factors that predict test scores. In it we
# run a t-test to test for statistic difference
# in the scores for White students and Black students.
# 
# We then run analysis of variance between the 4
# main ethnic/racial groups to see if there is statistical
# significance in the outcomes. We run an OLS regression
# on these groups with the "All Students" as a baseline
# reference category and display the ANOVA table and regression summary.
# 
# Finally, one run a different OLS regression to examine
# the school demographic factors and their effect on test scores.
# 
# In this notebook:
# 
# - t-test (review)
# - ANOVA (analysis of variance)
# - OLS (ordinary least squares) regression

will report on the t-test for weighted means that account for school size.

We see that there is a statistically significance difference in test scores between the groups.

# ### Pingouin results
# When we ran the t-test we saw that `pingouin` offers some useful additional features.
# The API (syntax for using) `pingouin` differes from `scipy`. Before we run the test, we
# create a new single dataframe with just the columns we care about. We tell the function which column
# is the dependent variable and which specifies the groups.
# 
# Below we show the [pinguion ANOVA](https://pingouin-stats.org/generated/pingouin.anova.html#pingouin.anova).

# OLS Linear Regression
# ---------------------
# The ANOVA tells us that there is a significant difference in test result based on racial/ethnic group. We can run a regression analysis to help us isolate the impact of different factors on our `mean_scale_score` -- our dependent variable.
# 
# For this analysis we will look at the school demographics to analyze the mean ELA test score for All Students at the school.
