# Layered Maps
# ============
# This mapping examples uses both the district maps and school location data to create visualizations and interactive maps.
# 
# Examples include:
# - calling multiple plots to create map layers
# - changing the mouse over and mouse click data for interaction

# In[3]:


# load and clean the school demographics and school location data
demo = schools.load_school_demographics()
df = geo.load_school_locations()
districts = geo.load_districts()


# Plotting twice: schools inside of districts
# --------------------------------------------
# In the code above, we've loaded the school demographic data and merged it with the school location data. `districts` contains the shape files for the
# 32 geographic districts in the NYC Schools.
# 
# In the cell below, we create a new figure and axis and then plot both the `districts` and the `schools` using `ax` -- the same axis. This makes a graph where schools are plotted on top of the districts.

# In[4]:


# create the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 16))

# first, plot the districts onto `ax`
districts.plot(ax=ax)
# second, plot the schools onto `ax`
_ = df.plot(ax=ax,color="red")


# Folium map with styles
# -----------------------
# We've seen how the `explore()` function generates an interactive, geographic [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) map. In this example we create an interactive district map where we specificy more of the styles for the map to give it a unique look. We save the map into the `district_map` variable because we're going to re-use it later.[link text](https://)

# In[5]:


district_map = districts.explore(
     column="district", # use district for the categories (aka chloropath)
     popup=False,
     tooltip="district",
     tiles="CartoDB positron", # use "CartoDB positron" tiles
     cmap="tab20b", # use "tab20b" matplotlib colormap
     style_kwds=dict(color="black") # use black outline
    )
district_map


# Custom pop-ups
# ---------------
# This example demonstrates how to use data from our dataframe to create custom interactions with our map using mouse-over and pop-up events. We create an HTML `div` element to hold the pop-up and to give it styles.
# 
# Our maps want to use hex colors, so the `dist_map` function uses a little
# translation function from `nycschools.ui` that takes a standard
# matplot lib color map and wraps it so that it returns hex colors.

    "Create a lighlty styled DIV to hold our pop-up data"

        return cmap(0)

# Layering Folium maps
# ---------------------
# In the first example, we plotted schools on top of a district plot using `matplotlib`. We can use the same approach to make more complex, interactive Folium maps with the `explore()` function in our `GeoDataFrame`. In this example we merge the school geo dataframe with our demographic data, then get a reduced set of shared columns to plot in the map. When we call `explore()` we pass the `district_map` in as the `m` argument, making that the base map for our plot.

# In[7]:


# get the columns we need for our pop-up
cols = ["dbn", "school_name", "total_enrollment", "poverty_pct", "asian_pct", "black_pct", "hispanic_pct", "white_pct"]


school_geo = df.merge(demo[cols], on="dbn")

school_geo = school_geo[cols + ["district",  "geometry", "x", "y"]]

school_geo["district_color"] = school_geo.district.apply(dist_map)
school_geo["school info"] = school_geo.apply(school_pop, axis=1)


school_geo.explore(m=district_map, tooltip=False, popup="school info", color="district_color")
