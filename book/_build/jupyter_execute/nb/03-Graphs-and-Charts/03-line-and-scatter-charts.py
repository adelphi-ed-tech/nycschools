# Line & Scatter Plots
# ====================
# This notebook introduces the methods of creating bar charts from our data, including some of the key concepts of our plotting package, `matplotlib`. Bar charts are useful for making comparisons between close data because we are very good at evaluating the size of rectangles.
# 
# Topics covered:
# 
# - bar charts
# - styling charts (titles, labels, size, color, etc)
# - grouped bar charts
# - tacked bar charts
# - new `school_data` package for custom code
# 
# To work on these examples we will use the demographics and ELA/Math test score data.

# Scatter plots and correlations

# student test scores on the NYS ELA exams, grades 3-8.

# 
# For the next correlation, first we'll drop the outliers by computing z-scores. Outliers can distort the results of our correlations.
