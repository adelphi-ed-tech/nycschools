# Bar Charts
# ==========
# This notebook introduces the methods of creating bar charts from our data, including some of the key concepts of our plotting package, `matplotlib`. Bar charts are useful for making comparisons between close data because we are very good at evaluating the size of rectangles.
# 
# Topics covered:
# 
# - bar charts
# - styling charts (titles, labels, size, color, etc)
#

import matplotlib as plt
from nycschools import schools

df = schools.load_school_demographics()


# Simple Bar Chart
# -------------------------
# We can quickly and easily create charts in `pandas` by calling
# the `bar.plot()` function on a `DataFrame`. The first step is to
# create a table where the data is ready to present.
# In this example, we'll create a bar chart from the school
# enrollment data in `df` (the school demographics).
# 
# We'll get started by borrowing the code from our `groupby` and `agg`
# examples.

# In[2]:


# get a few columns for just the 2020-21 school year
boros = df[["boro", "dbn", "total_enrollment", "ay"]]
boros = boros[boros.ay == 2020]

# group the data by borough
table = boros.groupby(by="boro").agg({
    "dbn":"count", 
    "total_enrollment":["sum", "mean", "min", "max"]}).reset_index()

# rename the columns with "pretty" names
cols = ["Borough", "Num. Schools", "Total Students", "Avg School Size", "Smallest School", "Largest School"]
table.columns = cols
table


# ### Drawing the plot
# Making a chart from our `table` is as simple as calling `plot.bar()`. In the example below we specify that we want enrollment (school size) as the vertical y-axis and Borough as our x-axis.

# In[3]:


ax = table.plot.bar(x="Borough", y=["Total Students"])


# In[4]:


# doe the same thing with average school size
ax = table.plot.bar(x="Borough", y=["Avg School Size"])


# Labels, figure size, and more
# ------------------------------------------
# We can make a pretty decent bar chart for a single line of code, but with a few more arguments to our function, we can make it even better. To do this, we're going to use a few more features from `matplotlib` and related libraries.
# 
# In this example we will specify:
# 
# - sorting the columns by size
# - setting the images size
# - adding titles and labels
# - changing colors
# 
# You may have noticed that we were assigning the **return** value from `plot()` into a new variable called `ax`. This servers the simple purpose of showing only the chart (and not the return value), but it also allows us to keep adding items to our chart. 

# In[5]:


# before drawing anything, change the "style"
plt.style.use('dark_background')

# show all the styles
# change dark_background to any style from this list to try it out
plt.style.available


# In[6]:


# sort the tabgle in descending order by school size -- this will order our bars
table = table.sort_values(by="Avg School Size", ascending=False)

ax = table.plot.bar(x="Borough", y=["Avg School Size"], color="violet")
ax.set_title("Average School Size by Borough (AY 2020-21)")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Students")
ax.get_legend().remove()
